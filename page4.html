                <p>Haemin Sunim lived in New York city, He was a celebrity buddhist monk, he was so popular because of his book, Love for Imperfect Things &amp; The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down.<br>

                    <br>The point of one of his books, The Love for Imprefect Things is to accept our flaws and remember the importance of loving ourselves in a imperfect world. The book explained how the expectations fall short. We often forgot how to appreciate our life and live in the moment instead of aiming for something greater everytime we achieved sucess. There is no shame in striving for more but forgeting to enjoy the moment and not being contented must be change.<br>

                    <br>The book reminds us that it is okay if we have not achieved our dreams yet, it is okay to not be okay and what really matters is that we are able to feel joy, accept and share our love to others by loving ourselves first.<br>

                    <br>Learnig to love ourselves with imperfections is very diffucult to most of people. They tend to project their insecurities sometime to others and use this as their defence mechanism. AS the en master Sengchan quote "True freedom is being without anxiety about imperfection" If we can never accept our flaws then we will never kmow the true freedom. We should have know ourselves better than anyone, improve ourselves with wisdom through experience. In this ways, we can embrace our own imperfection and use this as a motivation and learn something new to gain our confidence.
