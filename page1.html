                <p>Does it spark joy? she asked.<br>


                    <br>The famous question that went alll over social media also got me thinking if my stuffs still spark joy to me. I started to watch her Netflix show on how to declutter and properly dispose the stuffs you dont wan't in your life anymore.<br>

                    <br>I am a generally not a messy person. I always do cleaning once a week but my stuffs are still full on my cabinet. I got so many clothes that I don't wear anymore but it still lying on my cabinet.<br>


                    <br>When I watched her show, I am determined to follow her rules and tips on decluttering. It is a bit scary to start at first but I know this will feel amazing when I am done. <br>

                    <br>Creating this urge is the kind of thing at which Marie Kondo excels. She is brilliant at making what has previously seemed to be an ordinary, serviceable way of life seem lacking, drab, unjoyous. Or, if your life feels disastrously unorganized, Kondo promises that she can make it better. With Kondo’s trademark KonMari method, you can optimize not only your home but yourself. You can create a world in which absolutely everything around you sparks joy.

                <h2>They said that Marie Kondo is a celebrity of tyding<br></h2>

                <p><br>She started working as a professinal tidier in Japan at the age of 19. At the beginning she began tidying up for friend's home for sideline.<i>“Tidying was such an integral part of my daily life,”</i>she writes in her first book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,<i>“that it wasn’t until the day I started my own business that I realized it could be my profession.”</i> She was so successful that she became a celebrity in Japan.<br>

                    <br>Her book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up still popular in the US Market since 2014. Although Marie Kondo speaks a little bit of English, there were not many options to do a promotional tour<br>


                <h2><br>The KonMari method is aiming for joy<br></h2>

                <p><br>Marie Kondo has two essential parts on her method:discarding and sorting<br>

                    <br>First is the discarding, You have to collect everything you own or want to declutter like clothes, books, paper and etc. Then put it on the bed or on a massive floor. Take a look of that piles of stuff on the floor and think if it still spark joy, does it still gives you the need you want?<br>

                    <br>If the item sparks joy, then you can keep it, If it does not, you have to let go of that and give thanks for everything it has brought to your life.<br>

                <h3><br><i>“You are, after all, tidying up your own life. That brings stuff up.”</i><br></h3>

                <p><br><i>“Then something magical happened: I felt at peace with its disposal,” Silverberg writes. “I thanked each special item, and I really meant it.”</i><br>

                    <br><i>“Some may question whether paying attention to such details can possibly cause such a change,” she writes, “but why waste your time doubting if incorporating this exciting magic into all your storage spaces could keep your room tidy?”</i><br>

                    <br>Once the process is done, Kondo maintains that you will never have to tidy again:<i>“I never tidy my room,” she proclaims in the book. “Why? Because it is already tidy.”</i><br>

                    <br>Now, ask yourselves,does it still spark joy?<br>
