### Introduction

Hi there! Thia is the first website I have built with the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript only. This is a simple website for an online magazine named 'Lifestyle Scout' which promotes healthy lifestyle. It aims to help our readers to live happier and fuller with articles that will inspire them to have a healthy lifestyle. For my website, I chose to style it with a minimalist layout to give it a fresh look and domesticate an ambience for the reader. For my navigation bar, I made it simple as I can by positioning my search icon and Menu bar with my article links on each opposite side and my Logo at the center which acts as a home button. Also, I made a slideshow with four photos that link each article so that the readers could have a sneak peek at the article. As the reader scrolls down on the main page, they can find our tagline, featured authors, highlights of the week, recommended books, and some selected films where each section is linked to the respective webpage. Lastly, at the bottom of the page, they can find the footer where the readers can type their email for subscription and when they click the Subscribe button the alert box will show up.
